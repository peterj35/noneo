            The first chapter of the Analects has many passages describing learning. Many of the passages presented in 'Hakee' will serve as principles for those who wish to learn how to live their lives in a constant journey of acquiring a noble ethical value system, instead of being enslaved by personal greed. Confucius stressed to not be ashamed of what you are ignorant of, and to instead seek out enlightened persons and learn their ways, so that you could eventually live in an enlightened way yourself.

                To live virtuously does not mean to be naive or blindly trusting of others - a true philosopher and student of virtues must be able to distinguish those who are approaching them with sincerity, versus those who are approaching them for selfish gains.

                  People who have truly developed strong philosophical foundations for themselves are rarely seen as insecure or awkward. A common reason for the lack of success in social interactions may be because of the lack of personal identity and understanding of the current state of mind and circumstance.

                  Confucius argues that while an active aversion to the negative qualities created from the individual's status or situation is applaudable, those who have an active desire for virtuous qualities that would be difficult to come by in their current predicaments are much more noble.
