              Master You said: It is rare to find a person who is filial to his parents and respectful of his elders, yet who likes to oppose his ruling superior. And never has there been one who does not like opposing his ruler who has raised a rebellion. The junzi works on the root – once the root is planted, the dao is born. Filiality and respect for elders, are these not the roots of ren?

              There are few who have developed respect for their family and friends who enjoy offending their superiors unprovoked. Those who enjoy groundlessly offending others are those that add to the chaos. The established man focuses on the fundamentals. Once an individual is able to distinguish what it means to be ethical, the proper way to live appears. Having appreciation for your parents, respect for elders, and love for the ones you care about brings out the best in human goodness.

            We are able to tell early on about the role of hierarchy in Confucianism, where this passage seems to argue that the ‘lesser person’ should submit to the ‘upper person’ for a harmonious society. Nonetheless, this quote cannot be simply summarized as ‘hierarchy equals to peace and harmony’.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the English translation, usage of the word ‘superior’ makes it easy to assume exactly what may be superior. Many readers will regard this quote as a simple ‘being of older age / greater social status equates to superiority’, but in fact the true Confucian way of measuring superiority is largely based on the moral characteristics of that person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why does the Confucian school of thought consider the child's respect to the parents as a fundamental philosophy for living a harmonious and virtuous life? An obvious explanation may be that you should have respect and gratitude for those who raised you out of love when you were nothing but an infant. The realities of how you began life in a womb, and how shelter and food was provided the moment you were born should not be forgotten. To have respect does not necessarily mean to always consider your parents to be supremely wise or correct, it is simply to reciprocate the care and attention that was once provided for you. Even in their late senior years, there should never be cruel mockery or rudeness. Respect must be given where respect is due, in a sustainable form that makes sense for both you and your parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            If respect for your parents is born out of gratitude, then why should elders as a whole be respected as a fundamental building block to ethics as well? Just because they are older does it mean that they should be taken to be of greater consideration? To answer this question, one has to consider what it means for someone to be older. It means that they have lived more years, so in terms of the total duration of raw consciousness, they simply have a greater amount. Of course, the value of experiences must be considered as well, but that is only a secondary conclusion drawn out after the acceptance of their greater raw duration of consciousness. Therefore, it is not only polite, but also logical to initially offer the benefit-of-doubt to those who are older. Another factor why respect to the elderly is virtous is because it is the manifestation of a humble acceptance that you will grow old eventually yourself, and when you get there, you will want to be respected. A simple application of the well recognized philosophy, 'Never do onto others what you would not want done to yourself'.
          </p>
          <p>
            How can someone who is insightful enough to have genuine compassion for their parents and the elderly be fond of causing harm to society? That person must surely at least embody the concepts of gratitude and farsightedness. Finally, if this person even has a genuine disposition to their peers and the people around them, could you imagine them adding any sort of confusion or harm into the world?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the true, full meaning of this quote before those in superior positions (Empires against another empire, people in power) started using pro-hierarchy quotations such as these to enslave people or cater to their massive egos. The consideration of values or philosophies that logically inspire love for parents, friends, and elders, are often the most easy and obvious ways to build up one’s moral character.

          <h3>Further Commentary</h3>
          <p>
            As you can tell from the Eno translation, Confucius is not the originator of this passage, but instead a disciple by the name of You Ruo. Some passages in the Analects are not attributed to Confucius, but rather his disciples. This is a reason why many academics deduce that the Analects was written over a long period of time by different descendents of disciples.
          </p>
          <p>
            You Ruo was 13 years younger than Confucius, and is said to have looked and sounded similar to Confucius. This led some disciples to want to nominate You Ruo as the primary successor to the Confucian school of thought, but many of the other disciples disagreed and the idea was abandoned (good on them). Following Confucius' death, many of the disciples went on to form separate ideologies that focused on different aspects of Confucius' teachings, of which eventually may of these different schools of thought were reunited under the name 'Confucianism'.

            The concept of the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junzi"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Junzi</a>' (Ideal Person) is a frequently discussed term in the Analects, with some similarities to Socrates' 'Philosopher King', as the ultimate human who can embody the virtues of ethics and justice in their purest forms. In order to become 'Junzi', one must have '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_(Confucianism)"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Ren</a>' (a comprehensive ethical virtue). All that the Analects tries to accomplish is to describe the lifestyle of a person who lives by virtues and not of greed (Junzi), and to explain the concept of those virtues (Ren). The earliest insight of what this illusive concept of 'Ren' may be is explained in this passage. You Ruo described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> filial piety</a> and sibling-like love for one's friends as the fundamental blocks for living virtuously (with Ren!).
