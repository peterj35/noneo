              Master Zeng said: Each day I examine myself upon three points. In planning for others, have I been loyal? In company with friends, have I been trustworthy? And have I practiced what has been passed on to me?
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <p>
              Self-reflect daily upon three points. Firstly, in interaction with others, have I been helpful? Secondly, in company with friends, have I been genuine? Thirdly, have I strived to practice and master what I have learned?
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>1. In interaction with others, have I been helpful?</h3>
          <p>
            By helping others, you also help yourself. Life is much more than just watching out for your own good., and everyone loves someone who is positive and helpful in any situation.
          </p>
          <h3>2. In company with friends, have I been genuine?</h3>
          <p>
            Confucian ethics do not dictate you to be blindly kind or sacrifical towards your friends, but instead to be as genuine in your words and actions, as that is a much more sustainable and true form of loyalty.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Have I strived to practice and master what I have learned?</h3>
          <p>
            A constantly stressed theme of Confucianism, to acquire knowledge and to practice it, whether it be knowledge about ethics, human relationships, or academia.
          </p>
          <h3>Further Commentary</h3>
          <p>
            This passage once again is not attributed to Confucius, but rather a disciple who was 46 years younger than Confucius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zengzi"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Zengzi</a>. He was one of the last disciples that Confucius took under. It is well known that Confucius did not have a favorable evaluation of Zengzi, with records of Confucius explicitly saying "Zengzi is slow (stupid)". Nonetheless, he was well respected among the disciples for his extreme devotion to Confucius' teachings, and for his filial piety, and today is considered one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Sages"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>  Four Sages</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zengzi was the son of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Dian"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Zeng Dian</a>, one of the earliest disciples of Confucius, a disciple who was known to be a bit of a lunatic. Zeng Dian would often beat Zengzi, and one day Zengzi was beaten almost to death. Zengzi was concerned that his father would worry, so he started calmly playing his reed to convey that he was alright. When Confucius later heard of this story, Confucius berated Zengzi, criticizing his lack of adaptability for taking the beatings instead of trying to escape from Zeng Dian's beatings, arguing that an immense emotional burden would have been laid on the father if his son happened to be seriously wounded or die from the beatings. Confucius wasn't exactly known to be the most flexible or adaptive person when it came to relationships, but even in Confucius' eyes Zengzi had a tendency to be overly extreme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his shortcomings, Zengzi became Confucius' unofficial successor when the master died largely due to his young age and devotion to the teachings (also the absence of Yan Hui, an extremely gifted pupil who died at an early age). He tried to overcome his lack of intuition with pure memorization and recording of his master's teachings, and was able to transfer lots of knowledge to his disciples, which included the famous Mencius - who also came to be a major successor of Confucius' teachings. His disciples became very well versed in Confucian teachings than their competitors, and secured power within the circle. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Zengzi has been evaluated by modern scholars as an especially negative influence to Confucianism, and is frequently blamed for many of the adverse effects of Confucianism we can observe today, including the over-rigid social hierarchy philosophy (Confucius himself never spoke of a hierarchy, he spoke of responsibilities to others). Zengzi is said to have oversimplified the intricate Confucian ethics, a frequently cited example being that he reduced the nuanced ideal of "Parents must be parentlike, masters masterful, elders elderly, superiors morally superior <i>in order to be respected</i>," into a dangerous "Parents must be respected because they are parents, masters must be respected because they are masters, elders must be respected because they are elders, and superiors must be respected because they are superior." Mencius later made numerous attempts to drift away from Zengzi's teachings and back to Confucius' philosophies.
