            A great teacher has passed away. His family name Kong (孔), his personal name Qui (丘) - known by many today in the Latinized form, 'Confucius'.<a href="#c-1" class="citation" title="The only other Chinese philosopher known to Westerners by the Latinized form of the name is his most well-known disciple, Mencius - due to the first European interpreters of Chinese culture."><span id="rfn-1"></span>[1]</a> His teachings were magnificent and memorable, as was his life. The life of the master was not short, and there were countless valuable lessons he imparted. The disciples decide to collect his sayings and wisdom and compile it into a book - calling it 'Selected Speeches', or Analects.
          </p>
          <p>
            This text they were writing into strips of bamboo eventually surivive many generations and edits, to be compiled into 20 Chapters. The many outstanding interpretations and commentaries of the text by notable scholars throughout the rich Chinese history become as valuable as the original text itself. Today, the Analects is considered by many to be the authorative text of East Asian Philosophy, paralleling the Bible of the West in terms of social influence.

          <h3>Content and Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            The text is diffiult. A 2000 year old text that reads more like a collection of quotes rather than as a comprehensive literary work<a href="#c-2" class="citation" title="Such as Plato's Apology"><span id="rfn-2"></span>[2]</a> cannot help but be confusing. His sayings lack contextual elements, such as when, where, in what situation, in what way he imparted the saying to his disciples. Only the bare essences of his sayings remain<a href="#c-3" class="citation" title="It doesn't help that books were painfully expensive and time-taking to create in the ancient times."><span id="rfn-3"></span>[3]</a>, and therefore it is difficult to decipher the exact meaning, although many scholars throughout history have tried<a href="#c-4" class="citation" title="An Indiana University online resource on the Analects (source of the Eno Translations) jokes about how the randomness of the Analects has provided 'gainful employment and opportunities for tenure' (page iv)."><span id="rfn-4"></span>[4]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It does not help either that the ancient Chinese characters are vague<a href="#c-5" class="citation" title="Ancient Chinese characters are difficult to translate, because their meanings are more symbollic than semantic. For example, the original character for 'filial piety' (孝) is of the 'son' character (子) written beneath the 'senior' (耂) chracter to signify that the son is literally 'supporting' the senior.">[5]</a>, which accounts for the various translations of even the damn title of the book in English. This is an issue not unique to English translations, all interpretations into modern languages suffer from this ambiguity of the characters as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Plato's works which paint a portrait of Socrates' life and philosophies through a countinuous series of dialogue and events, the Analects is a collection of miscellaneous sayings collected from different disciples, which adds more to the difficulty.

            Therefore, I have made an active effort to 'modernize' many of his philosophies and written commentary on how I have perceived many of Confucian values and teachings in the present-day society. An attempt has been made to interpret the literal terminology of Confucianism into more relatable ideas and notions better understood by modern society. The interpretations presented are not to be taken as the most popular or scholarly interpretations.

          <h3>Chapters</h3>
          <p>
            The Noneo consists of 20 chapters. The title of the chapters do not signifiy the thematic elements of the chapter, but instead is just the first characters of the Chapters (excluding the well-known 'As Confucius said,' 子曰). I have taken effort to name the Chapters by their biggest thematic elements, to make the chapters more memorable and appealing to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first 10 chapters are commonly referred to as the "upper text", and the last 10 chapters as the "lower text". There is a notable distinction between the upper and lower texts, in terms of literary style and estimated dates of writing. The upper text is composed of passages that are short and brief, while the lower text is composed of passages that are long and wordy. Most historical estimates agree that the upper texts were written first, and have greater valilidity of actual Confucian teachings. For the purposes of the Noneo, there are valuable lessons and memorable quotes to be taken away from both the upper and lower texts equally.

            You can also click the 'Eno Translation' button to view the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_%28Eno-2015%29.pdf"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> translations</a> of <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ealc/people/eno.shtml"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Robert Eno</a>. I highly recommend the reading of at least the introduction of the source as it provides a great scholarly overview of the Analects. Robert Eno's translations were chosen over the numerous and various translations of the Analects available online in the public domain, as they remain loyal to the technical terms of Confucianism. While foreign terms add to the difficulty for translation and understanding, they are ultimately what anyone would need to study if they were to examine the Analects seriously. Here are the most important terms listed below, taken from the original translation source material.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Terms in the Eno Translations</h3>
          <p>
            Terms whose meaning seems to be so flexible, subtle, and disputed that it's best to leave them untranslated, using transcription for them:
          </p> 
          <ul>
            <li><i>Ren</i> 仁 / 인 - a comprehensive ethical virtue: benevolence, humaneness, goodness; the term is so problematic that many Analects passages show disciples trying to pin Confucius down on its meaning (he escapes being pinned).</li>
            <li><i>Junzi</i> 君子 / 군자 - often used to denote an ideally ethical and capable person; sometimes simply meaning a power holder, which is its original sense.</li>
            <li><i>Dao</i> 道 / 도 - a teaching or skill formula that is a key to some arena of action: an art, self-perfection, world transformation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Complex key term rendered by an English word, the meaning of which can only emerge as contextual usage is noted:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Virtue (de)</i> 德 / 덕 - a very complex concept, initially related to the notion of charisma derived from power and gift-giving, developing into an ethical term denoting self-possession and orientation towards moral action.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Important terms that can be translated with some accuracy into English, but only with the understanding that the conceptual range of the Chinese term may not match English perfectly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Right / Righteousness (yi)</i> 義 / 의 - often a complement to <i>ren</i>, denoting morally correct action choices, or the moral vision that allows one to make them.</li>
            <li><i>Loyalty (zhong)</i> 忠 / 충 - denoting not only loyalty to one's superiors or peers, or to individuals, but also to office; an alignment of self with the interests of others, or of the social group as a whole.</li>
            <li><i>Trustworthiness / Faithfulness (xin)</i> 信 / 신 - derived from the concept of promise keeping, meaning reliability for others, but also unwavering devotion to principle.</li>
            <li><i>Filiality (xiao)</i> 孝 / 효 - a traditional cultural imperative, obedience to parents, raised to a subtle level of fundamental self-discipline and character building.</li>
          </ul>
